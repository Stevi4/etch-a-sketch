# etch-a-sketch

This project was made following The Odin Project's Foundations course:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

The page contains a grid that produces a trail when the user mouses over it,
simmilar to an Etch-A-Sketch. The user is able to reset the grid or resize it
at any time using the side buttons. Additionally, the trail produces random
colors that fade out as the trail gets longer. The maximum length of the trail
in squares is equal to the side length of the grid, regardless of its size.
